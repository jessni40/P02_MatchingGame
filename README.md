# P02_MatchingGame

 This is a graphical application that represents a simple matching game with cards. The game is a one player memory game in which 12 cards are initially laid face down on a surface. Each turn, the player selects two face down cards, which are then flipped over. If the two cards match, they remain face up. Otherwise, they are both flipped face down. The player wins the game when they succeeds to turn over all pairs of matching cards. Fig.1 illustrates an example of what this program might look like when it is done.

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) application will be written using a PApplet object and PImage objects defined within the graphic processing library.
